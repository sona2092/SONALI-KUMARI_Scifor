What is a Restful API?

Ans - A REST API is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for representational state transfer.

1. Stateless: Each time a client makes a request to the server, it includes all the information needed for the server to fulfill the request. The server doesnâ€™t keep track of previous requests.

2. Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate. The client asks for data or actions, and the server provides them. They can be developed and updated independently.

3. Cacheable: Some responses can be stored by the client to reuse later, making the system more efficient.

4. Layered System: The system can be designed in layers, with intermediaries between the client and the server to improve performance and scalability.
